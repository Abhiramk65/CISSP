  [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A development team is using an agile methodology. During a sprint review, a security analyst identifies a new user story that introduces a significant security vulnerability. What is the MOST appropriate immediate action for the security analyst?",
      "options": [
        "Reject the user story and demand it be removed from the sprint.",
        "Log the vulnerability and address it in a later sprint.",
        "Collaborate with the development team to modify the user story and address the vulnerability within the current sprint.",
